        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a student who believes that technology and faith can work together to help the community. I focus on digital projects that promote kindness and service.<br>
        An inspirational portfolio highlights my goals, achievements, and personal growth. It serves as a reminder of my journey and the values that guide me, such as perseverance, faith, and dedication. By documenting my progress, I stay motivated to continue improving myself academically and personally.
<br>This portfolio also reflects the idea of being a “Light of the World” by inspiring others through positive actions and achievements. Sharing meaningful work encourages hope, creativity, and confidence. It shows that success is not only about accomplishments but also about character and purpose.
